## Disclaimer
Very early in development progress. 
You cannot run this in full screen.
Resizing Roblox don't work yet.

Currently tested in:
- Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti Mobile Edition
- Intel XE 80EU

May or not work in AMD, we don't know that

No binary builds due to my reputation being horrible, if you are technical enough read the source code line by line and carefully compile then run it in a VM with a gpu.
